description: A self-paced learning exercise for a large second year class that involves
  chemistry students and other STEM students taking this course as a required course
  for other programs. This exercise ties into CHEM 2P20 which introduces SciFinder
  and other resources. This tool introduces students to SciFinder structure searching,
  Reaxys as a new database and Espacenet and the value of patents to scientific inquiry.
  Exercises include green chemistry, reflecting on the science/medical literature
  when searching a known antibiotic for further inquiry and comments as part of a
  weekly lab exercise discussed by the faculty member during lectures and lab assistants
  for each section as one of the last labs/assignments for this course.Â 3 short videos
  using ppt slides created and posted on a libguide for students to watch on YouTube.
  These are important, one gives an overview of the exercise and commentary, one is
  for SciFinder show and tell, and a similar one for Reaxys. All watched heavily!
objective: "The objective of this exercise is to explore\nthe biomedical, chemistry,
  green and patent literature. This exercise involves\nsearching the chemistry literature
  in different ways looking for information,\narticles and patents using unique databases.
  Note a tab\ndedicated to the CHEM 2P21 exercise form, databases, resources, examples,
  and\nYouTube videos on the Library\nChemistry Research Guide. "
