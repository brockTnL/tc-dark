I"m<p>This collection is maintained by the Teaching and Learning department at the Brock University Library. Librarians have contributed their content in an effort to crowdsource teaching material, facilitate new and creative ways of teaching, and to help each other out when there is a need to fill a vacancy or a gap in service. Additionally, we made this an open resource so that on the off chance that you’ve stumbled upon it and are from outside of the Brock community, you can peruse our lessons and adapt as needed.</p>

<p>Facets is the result of the hard work of Angela Zoss and Alex Gil. I simply copy and paste their code again and again, ‘making it work’ somehow. Facets builds on the work of Marii Nyröp. The content displayed here is the hard work of Librarians at Brock University, in St. Catharines, Canada.</p>
