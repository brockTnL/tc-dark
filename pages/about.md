This collection is maintained by the Teaching and Learning department at the Brock University Library. Librarians have contributed their content in an effort to crowdsource teaching material, facilitate new and creative ways of teaching, and to help each other out when there is a need to fill a vacancy or a gap in service. Additionally, we made this an open resource so that on the off chance that you've stumbled upon it and are from outside of the Brock community, you can peruse our lessons and adapt as needed.
